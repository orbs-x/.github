# Next Project
You can see projects that are in the process of being made along with an <br>
explanation of the purpose of the project, and perhaps some example images will<br>
be included to make things clearer.

**Next Project List :**

- ## Pendulum Module.py
    We created this pendulum module to **make it easier** in calculating sorting algorithms, <br>
    aiming to make it easier to sort a list with just 1 line of code. <br>
  
    **Special Features:**
    > *Pendulum* - Function() | values ​​: list | Return : the middle number in a list
    > Example:
    ```python
    Pendulum.pendulum([9, 8 , 6, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3])
    ```
    > First of all, It will sort first into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, <br>
    > then it will return the middle number depending on how long the list is,<br>
    > the return will be like this: `[4, 5,6]`
